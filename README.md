# Margaux Gallery

> A Vue and Vuetify Gallery Webiste.

## Built With

* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - The Progressive JavaScript Framework
  - Setup Vue-Router for all our URL needs and Vuex for our central store.
* [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) - My favorite design frameworks
  - Did most of the heavy styling with this with a bit of Sass. Excited for V1.0.
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - One of the best BaaS out there
  - delegated all the images to the bucket database.
  - Love the NoSQL JSON database structure.
  - Added auth for normal user and admin support to edit both the Vuex $store and the database.
